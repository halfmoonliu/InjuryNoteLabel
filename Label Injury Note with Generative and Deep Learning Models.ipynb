    "## Label Injnury Narratives Using Generative and Deep Learning Models\n",
    "This project compares the performances of generative and deep learning models on document classification using real-world and synthesized data. The document classification task is to label a piece of injury narrative with the type of injury to each narrative."

    "### Dataset\n",
    "The dataset used is from a competition organized by NASA-Tournament Lab and National Institute for Occupational Safety & Health (NIOSH). The goal is to automate the processing of data in occupational safety and health (OSH)OSH surveillance systems. Specifically, given a free text injury report, such as \"_worker fell from the ladder after reaching out for a box._‚Äù , the task is to **assign a injury code** from the Occupational Injuries and Illnesses Classification System (OIICS). The details of the task and competition can be found in a [blogpost](https://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2020/02/26/ai-crowdsourcing/) by CDC (Center for Disease Control). The dataset is downloaded from [hugging face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mayerantoine/injury-narrative-coding). The winning solutions can be found on [NASA Tournament Lab's Github Page](https://github.com/NASA-Tournament-Lab/CDC-NLP-Occ-Injury-Coding)."
